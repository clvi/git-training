# Version control introduction

---

# Definition

> A component of software configuration management, version control, also known as revision control or source control,
is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information.
Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code, termed the "revision number", "revision level", or simply "revision".
Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the change.
Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged.

Source: [Wikipedia, Version Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)

---

# Main principles

* Each file update is tracked

* Updates are ordered by time, making an history

* The person who made the update is identified

* Simultaneous updates on several files may be grouped inside a single revision

* Updated made by several persons on the same projects are merged

* Every previous revision can be restored

---

# Development process using a version control system

1. Someone from the project team checks out the latest revision of the project
1. He/she updated one or several files
1. He/she saves the new revision with all his/hers updated, with a comment
1. He/she communicates the updates to the other members of the team
1. The updates are merged with the updates from the other team members
1. If the updates can't be merged automatically, its a *conflict*: it must be resolved manually.

---

# Version control usages

* Not only for code:
    * "documentation as code"
    * Small and static resources associated with code (images, small binaries)

* Do NOT use VCS for:
    * Compiled code (packages, libraries, ...)
    * Huge binaries or binaries that change really often (there are specialized system to manage this type of content)

---

# Why should I use a VCS?

* Automatic code and project backup

* Easier collaboration between team members

* Easier code understanding (through revision comments)

* Work simultaneously on different versions, and handle merge easily

* Pre-requisite to continuous integration

* Easier bug fixes

---

# Centralized / distributed

There are 2 VCS types: centralized, and distributed

**Centralized**:
A central server is the reference repository. Team members can not share code without the central server.

**Distributed**:
Each team member has a full copy of the files and their history. Everybody can work and share code without being dependent
of a central server.

---

# Some VCS tools

**Centralized**:

* Concurrent Versions System (CVS)
* SubVersioN (SVN)

**Distributed**:

* Git
* Mercurial

**Proprietary software**:

* IBM ClearCase
* Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS)

**Images and sound**:

* AlienBrain
* Perforce

# Git concepts

---

# Objectives

Know the main concepts of Git:

* distributed

* diff storage

* the zones
    * working directory
    * index / stage
    * repository

* the states
    * not versioned
    * updated
    * staged
    * not updated

---

# Git

* Git was created by Linus Torvalds on 2005

* Git is distributed
    * Each team member has a local copy of the repository
    * A network connexion is used only to share updated with other members
    * A same local repository may have several remote repositories

* Only file updates are stored
    * Network traffic is really small
    * Easier merge of updates

* Fully configurable
    * No constraints, only "default choices"

---

# Vocabulary

**Commit**: Saving some updates on one or several files in local repository history

**Branch**: Several commits, linked by "parent-of" relationships, through an "initial commit"

**Merge**: Merge, inside the history, several commits from different sources (local and remote, or different branches)

**Push**: Publish local commits to a remote repository

**Pull**: Get locally the updates published by other team members on the remote repository

---

# Git as a graph

Commits are the nodes of the graph.

![Git graph](images/git_graph.png)

---

# Local repository

* Local data is always in a local repository

* Local repository is a directory on filesystem, which contains:
    * Versioned files
    * A unique git configuration directory (`.git`)

* `.git` directory contains:
    * Remote repository/ies configuration
    * Reference index (eg. branches and commit ids)
    * Updates history

# Init the local repository 1/2

From an empty directory:

```
$ mkdir git-workshop-1
$ cd git-workshop-1
$ git init
Dépôt Git vide initialisé dans /tmp/git-workshop-1/.git/
```

---

class: tp

# Init the local repository 2/2

From a remote repository:

```
$ git clone https://some-remote.repo/depot_workshop_1
Cloning into 'depot_workshop_1'...
remote: Counting objects: 62, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (29/29), done.
remote: Total 62 (delta 26), reused 62 (delta 26), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (62/62), 6.33 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (26/26), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
```

Protocol:

* HTTPS with login and password
* SSH with pair of key (better security and easier usage)

Checks out de repository default branch. Default name: `master`.

# The zones

Git has 3 zones:

* Working directory
* Git directory
* index zone, or staging zone

The *Working directory* is where all project files (.java, .sh, .html, ...) are stored locally.
When a team member works, he/she updates files in this directory.

The *Git directory* is alwyas named `.git` and is at the root of the working directory.
It contains git metadata and the history.

The *Index zone*, or *Staging zone*, if a file stored in the *Git directory*.
It contains all the updates selected to be included in the next commit.

# Saving updates

2 steps:

1. Select the files to be included in the commit, and index them:

```
$ vi COMMIT.md
$ git add COMMIT.md
```

2. Commits changes:

```
$ git commit -m "Création du fichier COMMIT"
[master (commit racine) 03ef10c] Création du fichier COMMIT
1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
create mode 100644 COMMIT.md
```

---

# Update the last commit

The last **local commit** can be ammended to add updates or to change the commit message.

```
$ vi COMMIT.md
$ git add COMMIT.md
$ git commit -m "Création du fichier COMMIT avec 1 titre" --amend
[master 0923b76] Création du fichier COMMIT avec 1 titre
Date: Thu Mar 24 22:16:46 2016 +0100
1 file changed, 6 insertions(+)
create mode 100644 COMMIT.md
```

Don't forget to reindex all files that must be added to the commit, even if those files were already in the initial commit!

---

# Ignore a file

File named `.gitignore`, at the root level of the working directory.

Add files and paths to ignore in this file.

Supports wildcards (*)

```
# IntelliJ
*.iml
.idea

# Maven
target/
/.m2

# Eclipse
.project
.settings
.classpath
```

---

# File states

A file in the *working directory* can be...

* not versioned
* unchanged
* updated
* indexed

![File states](images/file_states.png)

---

# Check local repository status

`git status`: shows not versioned, updated and indexed files.

```
$ git status
Sur la branche master
Modifications qui seront validées :
modifié :	UPDATED.md
nouveau fichier :	NEW.md
Modifications qui ne seront pas validées :
modifié :	COMMIT.md
Fichiers non suivis:
STATUS.md
```

---

# Use history 1/2

`git log`: Shows history, with more or less details depending on options

```
$ git log

# Communicate with remote repository

Use `git push` to send local commited updates to remote repository

Use `git pull` to get updates published by other team members from remote repository.
It also merge them with local commits, if any.

To get updates from remote repository without merging them with local commits, use `git fetch`.

# git fetch and pull example

```
$ git fetch
